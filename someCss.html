        <p style="font-family: fantasy">	My inspiration derives from a variety of individuals, one of whom being Michelle Obama. Michelle Obama is a powerful activist, and an overall inspiring woman. I hope to one day achieve even half of the success she has accomplished in her career. The former First Lady, with her passion for empowering youth, once said, “The ability to read, write, and analyze; the confidence to stand up and demand justice and equality; the qualifications and connections to get your foot in that door and take your seat at that table – all of that starts with education.” I wholeheartedly agree with this statement; an individual’s educational is central in the development of their character, and their future.</p>
        <p style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif"> if I had to describe the type of person I hope to be in the future in two words, I would say happy and well-traveled. To reemphasize, I believe that one learns best when interacting with those of different cultures and experiences, and I hope to travel a majority of the world. Thinking about the future and all the worlds I have yet to explore excites me. I can’t wait to learn new lifestyles, languages and customs. Most of all, I hope to be happy, which to me, is all encompassing. Happiness may mean a family or it may mean success, and while I hope to have/be both of these things, as long as I am content with my life, that is all that matters.
